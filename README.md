# Code-brew
The ultimate website for learning and using ciphers with a place to talk with other coders.
<br>
Features:
<ul>
  <li>Public messaging system</li>
  <li>Friends system (beta)</li>
  <li>Codebreaker</li>
  <li>Puzzles (beta)</li>
  <li>Learn</li>
  <li>Playground</li>
  <li>Cipher creator (beta)</li>
  <li>Settings panel - customize website appearance and choose ciphers for the messaging system</li>
</ul>

Public messaging system - in this feature you can communicate with all users that are registered on code brew. The messages that you send will be indicated with your username and the time you sent it. When you hover one somebodies profile, you will be able to see their email as well as a larger profile view which contains information such as 
<ol>
  <li>Your username</li>
  <li>Your email</li>
  <li>Your username</li>
  <li>Your about me</li>
  <li>Your programming langauges</li>
  <li>Your message count</li>
</ol>
You will also have the option to see a users' cipher statistics page, which will show a that users' proficiency in the six ciphers that you can train on the website.
<br>
Friends system - You would be able to add friends that are registered on code brew and send one to one private messages to them.
<br>
Codebreaker - This has three separate tools - <ol><li><b>A shift cipher cracker</b>.</li> <li><b>A vigenere cipher cracker</b>.</li> <li><b>A frequency analysis tool</b>.</li></ol>.
<br>
The <b>shift cipher cracker</b> will allow you to crack messages that have been encrypted with shift ciphers such as the caeser cipher. As shift ciphers only have 26 possibilties for a shifted message, this tool will check all 26 possibilities of a decrypted message and then use a formula utilizing the standard letter distributions to get the optimal shift for the text. 
<br>
The <b>Vigenere cipher cracker</b> will allow you to get the key and the decrypted text for a passage that is encrypted with the Vigenere cipher. This performs two tests that are designed for Vigenere cryptanalysis - the <b>Kasiski Test</b> and the <b>Friedman Test</b>. The Kasiski test will give you the most probable key length for the passage and the Friedman Test uses this output to break up the passage into blocks of the key length and treat every repeat of the key length as an individual caeser cipher (as the shift will repeat) giving you the decrypted passage.
